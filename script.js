    subtitle: 'An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is a planet outside our Solar System. A planet within the solar system is famously defined by the IAU as follows:',
    body: `<ul><li>Must be in orbit around the Sun.</li><li>Has sufficient mass to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., a round shape).</li><li>Has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.</li></ul><br>For exoplanets, we generally extend the first criterion to objects orbiting stars other than the Sun.`,
    notes: `Do not spend too long debating formal definitions. The practical point for detection is: planets are faint companions. The observable is usually not the planet surface; it is the planet’s effect on the system. There are also free floating exoplanets / rogue planets, etc.`

    notes: `Exoplanet science changed astronomy quickly: before the 1990s, there were no confirmed planets around Sun-like stars. Now exoplanets are a normal part of astrophysics. Fermi famously asked whether we're alone in the universe- exoplanets are some of our foremost candidates for extraterrestrial life.`

    notes: `This slide prepares the audience for why methods are complementary. Transit based detection can help us detect radius; radial velocity gives mass information; together they can give us something like the density of the planet (which tells us whether its rocky, a gas giant, etc.). Spectroscopy might tell us about its atmosphere.`

    notes: `Use a simple analogy: finding a planet beside a star is like finding a firefly next to a searchlight from kilometres away. The cleverness of exoplanet detection is that we often do not need to see the planet itself; we only need a reliable, repeatable fingerprint.`

    subtitle: '',
    body: `Star systems can be wildly different from the solar system. For instance, about 3 years after the first exoplanet was discovered, astronomers came across 51 Pegasi. This is a star very similar to our own sun. Using certain techniques, they detected a massive gas giant orbiting very close to the star (with an orbital period of only 4.2 days). This was a type of exoplanet known as a "Hot Jupiter"- which had previously only been theorized. With only our own solar system to go off of, this discovery was considered very surprising at the time. In general, most of the 6000 exoplanets we have discovered so far have been around F, G, and K-type stars (similar to or slightly different from our Sun). These stars are common, stable, and live long anough to make planet detection easier. Smaller stars have planets hard to detect with common methods, while hot and massive stars show much weaker observable effects from their planets. Astronomers naturally focused on the more accessible stars because expensive planet-hunting missions will obviously aim for the best chance of success.`,
    notes: `Explain why this discovery was weird: a Jupiter-mass planet so close to its star was not what the Solar System had trained astronomers to expect. This pushed planet migration and formation theories forward.`

In certain cases where the host star gives us some sort of periodic signal, this gives us a way to detect exoplanets by variations in the measured time period of that signal (due to change in distance over the star's orbit).

Basically, <ul><li>Millisecond pulsars can be timed with extreme precision.</li><li>If a planet makes the pulsar orbit the barycentre, the light travel distance changes.</li><li>That creates early/late arrival times called timing residuals.</li></ul>`,
